#OpeNDAP-OCO-2-Satellite-Data_web_scraping.
The parser for OpeNDAP NASA OCO-2 Satellite Data is presented in this python code. The URL of the site: https://oco2.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/opendap/OCO2_L2_Lite_FP.10r/contents.html
The user can collect XCO2 data from 2014 to 2022 in csv format. Each file is recorded in a separate folder. All these subfolders must be collected in the folder called 'nasa_files', so that before the launching of the program it is necessary to create folder with name 'nasa files'. This project was emplemented in google-colab.
